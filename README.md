This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000/firstjs](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

Create a Next.js Project with TypeScript:
Set up a new Next.js project with TypeScript integration.
Display Ad Banners on the Home Page:
Create a list of ad banners on the homepage (Power this using JSON list).
Each ad banner should include the following elements:
Title
Description
CTA (Call-to-Action)
Image
Background/Template
Add Edit Functionality:
Each ad banner should have an edit icon.
Clicking the edit icon should open a bottom sheet where users can modify the details/elements of the ad banner.
The ad banner should update with the new details once the changes are saved
